# Basic-Excel-Dashboard

Project Overview:

 Data Cleaning: 
 -----> Implemented data cleaning techniques such as adding filters, removing duplicates, handling missing data, and correcting data type issues. 
 -----> Conducted data validation by identifying and replacing misspelled values.

Data Processing: 
-----> Extracted month and year information from the date column for improved analysis.

Data Analysis & Visualization: 
* Created an Excel dashboard with the following key visualizations:

Total Casualties by Vehicle Type: Utilized pivot tables to analyze and visualize total casualties categorized by vehicle type.
Total Casualties by Road Type and Surface Type: Employed pivot tables to analyze and visualize total casualties based on road type and surface conditions.
Total Casualties by Location (Urban/Rural) and Light Condition (Dark/Daylight): Utilized pivot tables to analyze and visualize total casualties concerning location and light conditions.
Dashboard Design: Designed an Excel dashboard with interactive elements, including donut charts, bar charts, line charts, treemaps, slicers, and a timeline chart.

Donut Chart: Utilized to compare casualties based on severity levels (Fatal, Slight, Serious).
Treemap: Used to represent casualties based on different surface types (Dry, Wet, Snow).
This project aimed to acquire fundamental Excel skills in data cleaning, processing, analysis, and creating a basic dashboard with interactive visualizations.
